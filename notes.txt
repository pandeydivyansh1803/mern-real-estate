part 6) creating signup backend 
part 7) creating signup frontend
important parts were how to use formData and setFormData, show and hide passoword feature
also understanding and defining proxy in vite.config.js file

export default defineConfig({
  server : {
    proxy:{
      '/api' : {
        target : 'http://localhost:3000',
        secure: false,
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [react()],
})


Another imp part is loading effect 
when the backend request is sent and while we have not yet received res , we need to disable the signup button
we will use another state variable loading initially false , for the button we need to disabled it when loading is true code :  disabled:{loading}
also when loading we need to change the text on the button {loading ? "loading" : "SIGN UP"}
